# Image_sorter
Very basic GUI to sort images in their respective folders (e.g for a machine learning classification task or simply tidy up your system)

example: python main.py -cl "dog" "cat" "unsure" -p "D:\animal_images\images"

will start the GUI with 3 buttons dog, cat and unsure. The images contained in the images folder will be sorted in their respective folder inside images_sorted 
```bash 
───animal_images
    ├───images
    ├───images_sorted
    │   ├───dog
    │   ├───cat
    │   ├───unsure
 ```
